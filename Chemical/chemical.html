            <h3>Direct discharge:</h3>
            <p>
                Chemical pollutants can be directly discharged into waterways from industrial facilities, sewage
                treatment plants, and agricultural runoff.

            <h3>Harm aquatic life:</h3>
            <p>
                Chemical pollutants can harm aquatic life by poisoning them, disrupting their reproductive cycles, and
                damaging their habitats.

                Pesticides and herbicides can enter waterways from agricultural runoff and stormwater runoff. These
                chemicals can harm aquatic life and contaminate drinking water.

            Controlling pollution in water is essential for preserving natural resources, protecting ecosystems, and
            ensuring the long-term sustainability of food production. It often requires a combination of regulatory
            measures, education, and the adoption of best practices by people.
            It's important to note that the specific strategies to reduce pollution in water can vary by region and type
            of water. Sustainable and environmentally friendly farming practices should be tailored to local conditions
            and regulations. Collaboration between farmers, government agencies, and environmental organizations is
            often necessary to implement effective pollution-reduction measures in water.
