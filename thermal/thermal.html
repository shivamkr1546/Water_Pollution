            <h3>Disrupting the temperature balance of aquatic ecosystems:</h3>
            <p>
                Aquatic ecosystems are adapted to a specific temperature range. When heated water is discharged into a
                waterway, it can disrupt the temperature balance of the ecosystem, making it more difficult for aquatic
                organisms to survive and reproduce.

        <div class="Reducing_dissolved_oxygen_levels">
            <h3>Reducing dissolved oxygen levels:</h3>
            <p>
                Warmer water holds less dissolved oxygen than cooler water. This can make it difficult for aquatic
                organisms to breathe, especially those that are already stressed by the higher temperature.

        <div class="Increasing_the_toxicity_of_pollutants">
            <h3>Increasing the toxicity of pollutants:</h3>
            <p>
                Some pollutants, such as heavy metals, are more toxic in warmer water. This can make water more
                dangerous for aquatic organisms and humans alike.

    <div class="Promoting_the_growth_of_harmful_algae_blooms">
        <h3>Promoting the growth of harmful algae blooms: </h3>
        <p>
            Algae blooms can occur when there is too much nitrogen and phosphorus in the water. Warmer water can promote
            the growth of algae blooms, which can deplete oxygen levels in the water and make it toxic for aquatic life.

    <div class="Power_plants">
        <h3>Power plants:</h3>
        <p>
            Power plants use water to cool their turbines. This water is then discharged back into the environment at a
            higher temperature.

    <div class="Industrial_facilities">
        <h3>Industrial facilities:</h3>
        <p>
            Many industrial facilities use water in their production processes. This water is often discharged back into
            the environment at a higher temperature.
        </p>
    </div>

    <br />
    <div class="Urban_runoff">
        <h3>Urban runoff: </h3>
        <p>
            Stormwater runoff from urban areas can be heated by roads, rooftops, and other surfaces. This heated runoff
            can then be discharged into waterways.

        <h3>Dams:</h3>
        <p>
            Some people illegally dump sewage or other hazardous waste into waterways. This can cause serious water
            pollution.

        Controlling pollution in water is essential for preserving natural resources, protecting ecosystems, and
        ensuring the long-term sustainability of food production. It often requires a combination of regulatory
        measures, education, and the adoption of best practices by people.
        It's important to note that the specific strategies to reduce pollution in water can vary by region and type of
        water. Sustainable and environmentally friendly farming practices should be tailored to local conditions and
        regulations. Collaboration between farmers, government agencies, and environmental organizations is often
        necessary to implement effective pollution-reduction measures in water.
