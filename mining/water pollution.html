                thermal pollutants. </p>
                <br/>
        <h2>2. Different type of Water pollution:</h2>
            <p>  water pollution can be categorized into various types based on different criteria. One common 
                classification is based on the source of pollution, which includes point source pollution and
                non-point source pollution:</p>
                <br/>

            <h3>*Point Source Pollution:-</h3>
                
                <h4>.  Definition:</h4> Point source pollution refers to the contamination of water from a single, identifiable
                source or location. These sources typically discharge pollutants into water bodies through specific
                conveyances, such as pipes or ditches.
                <p><u>Examples:</u>Common examples of point source pollution include:</p>

                <h4>.  Industrial discharges:</h4> Factories and manufacturing facilities often release pollutants directly into
                nearby water bodies through pipes.

                <h4>.  Municipal wastewater treatment plants:</h4> These facilities treat sewage but can still release treated 
                effluent into rivers or oceans.

                <h4>.  Oil spills:</h4> Accidental spills from ships or offshore drilling platforms are considered point source
                pollution.
