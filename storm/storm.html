            <h3>Stormwater runoff:</h3>
            <p>
                Stormwater is rainwater that drains off of impervious surfaces like roads, rooftops, and parking lots.
                As it flows, it picks up pollutants like oil, grease, metals, and chemicals. Stormwater runoff is often
                discharged directly into waterways without treatment.

            <h3>Illicit dumping:</h3>
            <p>
                People sometimes illegally dump hazardous waste, such as used motor oil and paint, into storm drains or
                waterways. This can cause serious water pollution.

            <h3>Sewage:</h3>
            <p>
                Sewage is wastewater from homes and businesses. It contains a variety of pollutants, including fecal
                coliform bacteria, nutrients, and harmful chemicals. Sewage treatment plants can remove many of these
                pollutants, but they are not always effective or efficient.

                Industrial wastewater is wastewater from factories and other industrial facilities. It can contain a
                wide range of pollutants, including toxic chemicals, heavy metals, and oil and grease. Industrial
                wastewater must be treated before it is discharged into waterways, but some facilities may violate
                environmental regulations or have accidents that lead to spills.

            <h3>Garbage: </h3>
            <p>
                Garbage that is not properly disposed of can pollute waterways. When garbage is dumped on the ground or
                in storm drains, it can be washed into waterways by rain or snowmelt. Garbage can contain a variety of
                pollutants, including chemicals, bacteria, and viruses.

            <h3>Driving and parking:</h3>

                Cars and trucks leak oil, gasoline, and other pollutants onto roads and parking lots. These pollutants
                can then be washed into waterways by stormwater runoff.

                Soaps, detergents, and other chemicals used to wash cars and driveways can pollute waterways if they are
                not properly disposed of.

            Controlling pollution in uraban activities is essential for preserving natural resources, protecting
            ecosystems, and ensuring the long-term sustainability of food production. It often requires a combination of
            regulatory measures, education, and the adoption of best practices by people.
            It's important to note that the specific strategies to reduce pollution in water can vary by region and type
            of water. Sustainable and environmentally friendly farming practices should be tailored to local conditions
            and regulations. Collaboration between farmers, government agencies, and environmental organizations is
            often necessary to implement effective pollution-reduction measures in water.
