                <h3>Drinkable Water</h3>
                <p>Freshwater, a fundamental component of the Earth's hydrosphere, encompasses water present in rivers, lakes, groundwater, and glaciers. However, only a small fraction of the world's water supply is fresh and readily usable. Approximately 97.5% of the Earth's water is in the oceans and is saline, leaving merely 2.5% as freshwater. Out of this small fraction, about 70% is locked in ice caps and glaciers, rendering it inaccessible for immediate use. This leaves a mere 0.5% of the Earth's water as surface and groundwater, which is the primary source of fresh water for various purposes such as drinking, agriculture, and industry. Given this scarcity, it becomes imperative for us to manage and utilize this precious resource sustainably to meet the needs of a growing global population.</p>

                    <h3>Oil Pollution</h3>
                    <p>Oil pollution in water bodies has severe and far-reaching consequences on the environment and ecosystems. When oil is released into water, it forms a thin layer on the surface, blocking sunlight and oxygen exchange, thus suffocating marine life. The toxic compounds in oil can contaminate water, harming aquatic plants, animals, and birds.

                        Fish and other marine organisms can ingest or absorb these toxic substances, leading to health issues, reproductive problems, and even death. Additionally, oil spills can coat the feathers and fur of animals, making them heavy and less buoyant, further impeding their ability to move and hunt effectively. The contamination can disrupt the food chain, impacting predator-prey relationships and altering the balance of the ecosystem.

                        Cleanup efforts, although necessary, often involve using additional chemicals, which can introduce more pollutants into the water. Long-term effects of oil pollution can persist for years, making it imperative to prevent oil spills and diligently manage oil-related activities to safeguard our oceans, rivers, and other water bodies.<a href="oil/oil.html" target="_blank"> ...read more</a>

                    <h3>Mining Operations</h3>
                    <p>While there have been improvements to mining practices in recent years, significant environmental risks remain. Negative impacts can vary from the sedimentation caused by poorly built roads during 
                        exploration through to the sediment, and disturbance of water during mine construction. Water pollution from mine waste rock and tailings may need to be managed for decades, if not centuries, after 
                        closure. These impacts depend on a variety of factors, such as the sensitivity of local terrain, the composition of minerals being mined, the type of technology employed, the skill, knowledge and environmental 
                        commitment of the company, and finally, our ability to monitor and enforce compliance with environmental regulations. One of the problems is that mining has become more mechanized and therefore able to handle more 
                        rock and ore material than ever before. Therefore, mine waste has multiplied enormously. As mine technologies are developed to make it more profitable to mine low grade ore, even more waste will be generated in the 
                        future.<a href="mining/mining.html" target="_blank"> ...read more</a>

                    <h3>Stormwater Drainage</h3>
                    <p>Urban stormwater drainage systems play a significant role in contributing to water pollution. When rainwater flows over impervious surfaces like roads, rooftops, and parking lots, it collects various pollutants such as oil, grease, heavy metals, pesticides, fertilizers, and sediment. As this polluted stormwater is channeled into drainage systems and eventually discharged into rivers, lakes, or oceans, it can have detrimental effects on water quality and aquatic ecosystems.

                        The contaminated stormwater not only degrades the water bodies it enters but also poses a risk to human health and wildlife. The pollutants can harm aquatic life by disrupting habitats, interfering with reproduction, and causing long-term health issues. Additionally, chemicals and toxins in stormwater runoff can contaminate drinking water sources, making it unsafe for human consumption.

                        Efforts to mitigate this problem include implementing best management practices (BMPs) such as sediment basins, vegetated swales, and retention ponds to filter and treat stormwater before it enters natural waterways. Public education and awareness campaigns regarding responsible disposal of waste and proper use of chemicals can also help in reducing stormwater pollution and safeguarding water quality.<a href="storm/storm.html" target="_blank"> ...read more</a>

                    <h3>Sewage</h3>
                    <p>Water pollution caused by sewage and wastewater is a pressing environmental concern that impacts both aquatic ecosystems and human health. Sewage and wastewater often contain harmful chemicals, pathogens, and pollutants that, when discharged into rivers, lakes, or oceans without proper treatment, contaminate the water and pose significant risks.

                        Improperly treated or untreated sewage and wastewater can introduce high levels of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus into water bodies. These nutrients can lead to excessive algal growth, creating "dead zones" where oxygen levels are depleted, harming aquatic life and disrupting the balance of the ecosystem. Furthermore, sewage and wastewater often contain heavy metals, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and other pollutants that are hazardous to marine life and can accumulate in the food chain.

                        Human activities and urbanization significantly contribute to this issue. Rapid urban growth and inadequate sewage treatment infrastructure in many areas lead to the direct discharge of untreated sewage into water bodies. Industrial discharges and agricultural runoff further exacerbate the problem, adding to the pollution burden.

                        Addressing water pollution from sewage and wastewater requires a multifaceted approach, including improved sewage treatment facilities, stricter regulations, better waste management practices, and public awareness campaigns. Sustainable urban planning and responsible waste disposal are vital to reducing the impact of sewage and wastewater on our water resources and preserving the health of both aquatic ecosystems and the communities that depend on them.<a href="sewage/sewage.html" target="_blank"> ...read more</a>

                <h3>Silation</h3>
                <p>Silt refers to the dirt, soil, or sediment that is carried and deposited by our water. While some silt in water is normal and healthy, many additional tons of silt find their way to our water every year, negatively impacting water quality. This pollution, known as siltation, results from erosion and land disturbing human activities, such as agriculture and construction.

                    Siltation negatively impacts ecosystems in many ways. Excessive silt clogs gills, and smothers eggs and nests. It can bury habitat aquatic insects need for survival, which impacts organisms up the food chain that eat these insects for survival. Siltation can also interfere with photosynthesis in aquatic plants resulting in a decrease in needed dissolved oxygen. Important components of aquatic habitat, which native aquatic species rely on for survival, are altered by siltation. These include the amount of light, the temperature, depth, and flow of water. In addition, pollutants like fertilizers, pathogens, pesticides, and heavy metals can be attached to soil particles that find their way to our water.
                    
                    Siltation also increases levels of treatment needed for drinking water, fills up reservoirs and navigation channels, and increases a waterbodies likelihood of flooding. <a href="agriculture/new.html" target="_blank"> ...read more</a>

                <p>Thermal pollution, sometimes called "thermal enrichment", is the degradation of water quality by any process that 
                  changes ambient water temperature. Thermal pollution is the rise or drop in the temperature of a natural body of water 
                  caused by human influence. Thermal pollution, unlike chemical pollution, results in a change in the physical properties 
                  of water. A common cause of thermal pollution is the use of water as a coolant by power plants and industrial 
                  manufacturers.[1] Urban runoff—stormwater discharged to surface waters from rooftops, roads, and parking lots—and 
                  reservoirs can also be a source of thermal pollution.[4] Thermal pollution can also be caused by the release of very cold 
                  water from the base of reservoirs into warmer rivers. of waste and proper use of chemicals can also help in reducing 
                  stormwater pollution and safeguarding water quality.<a href="thermal/thermal.html" target="_blank"> ...read more</a>

            <h3>Chemical Pollutants</h3>
            <p>Chemical pollutants are one of the most common types of water pollutants and can have severe impacts on the environment 
                1234. These pollutants can come from a variety of sources, including industrial and agricultural activities, mining, and 
                urban runoff .
                Metals and solvents used in industrial work can pollute rivers and lakes, which can be poisonous to many forms of aquatic 
                life and may slow their development, make them infertile or even result in death 1. Pesticides used in farming to control 
                weeds, insects, and fungi can also cause water pollution and poison aquatic life 13.
                Petroleum is another form of chemical pollutant that usually contaminates water through oil spills when a ship ruptures. 
                Oil spills usually have only a localized effect on wildlife but can spread for miles. The oil can cause the death of many 
                fish and stick to the feathers of seabirds causing them to lose the ability to fly 1

    <div class="effects_p">
        <p>The effect of water pollution depends upon the type of pollutants and their concentration. Also, the location of water bodies is an important factor to determine the levels of pollution.

            Water bodies in the vicinity of urban areas are extremely polluted. This is the result of dumping garbage and toxic chemicals by industrial and commercial establishments.
            Water pollution drastically affects aquatic life. It affects their metabolism, and behaviour, and causes illness and eventual death. Dioxin is a chemical that causes a lot of problems from reproduction to uncontrolled cell growth or cancer. This chemical is bioaccumulated in fish, chicken and meat. Chemicals such as this travel up the food chain before entering the human body.
            The effect of water pollution can have a huge impact on the food chain. It disrupts the food chain. Cadmium and lead are some toxic substances, these pollutants upon entering the food chain through animals (fish when consumed by animals, humans) can continue to disrupt at higher levels.
            Humans are affected by pollution and can contract diseases such as hepatitis through faecal matter in water sources. Poor drinking water treatment and unfit water can always cause an outbreak of infectious diseases such as cholera, etc.
            The ecosystem can be critically affected, modified and destructured because of water pollution.

      <b>Case Study on Yamuna River:</b>The Yamuna is one of the most important rivers of north India. It passes through Uttarakhand, Haryana,
       Delhi, and Uttar Pradesh. It merges with the Ganga at Allahabad in Uttar Pradesh. At one time, it was the lifeline for the people of 
       the area, but today it is the most polluted river of the country..Though the Yamuna starts getting polluted by pesticides and 
       fertilisers as it enters Haryana, most of 
      the pollution occurs in Delhi. More than 10 million people live in Delhi. Yet it does not have a proper sewage disposal system.
      Nineteen drains from Delhi open into the Yamuna. At one time, these carried rainwater. But because of the poor sewage disposal system, 
      water carrying sewage is discharged into these drains, from where it finds its way to the river.
      In Delhi, along a stretch, the Yamuna is choked by water hyacinth—a weed. This is an example of eutrophication. Dead fish are also found
       in the river as soon as the monsoon begins. This is due to the sudden increase in pesticide and other pollutant levels.

        <!----------------------------------------- PREVENTION -------------------------------------------------->

        <div class="prevention" id="prevention">
            <h2>How To Prevent Water Pollution</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="prevention_p">
            <p>
                <b>1. Proper Waste Disposal</b>
                    Encouraging the responsible disposal of hazardous materials and chemicals is vital. Individuals, businesses, and industries should use 
                    designated disposal sites to prevent pollutants from entering water systems.
                <br>
        <div class="prowaste">
            <p><div id="prowaste_b"><b>Steps we can take towards Proper Waste Disposal.</b></div><br> 
                a) Contain and collect your wastewater.<br>
                b) Use the sanitary sewer system, one of the Water Reclamation Facilities, or a private treatment company to dispose of it. 
                c) You may need to pre-treat your water before disposal.<br>
                d) Dispose of toxic chemicals, such as household solvents, pesticides, and cleaners, properly. Do not pour them down the drain or into 
                the waterways.<br>
                e) Use phosphate-free detergent and dish cleaner, and do not pour fat and grease down the drain.<br>
                f) Check your sump pump or cellar drain for leaks or spills.<br>
                g) Dispose of medical waste properly. Do not flush them down the toilet or throw them in the trash.<br>
                h) Eat more organic food to reduce the use of pesticides and fertilizers.<br>
                i) Report water polluters to the authorities.
            </p>
            <br>
        </div>
    <b>2. Reduce, Reuse, Recycle</b>
    Minimizing waste generation by promoting recycling and reusing materials reduces the strain on landfills and the potential for leaching 
    pollutants into groundwater.
    <br>
    <div class="rrr">
        <div id="rrr_b"><b>The Three R's</b></div>
        <p>One way to prevent and reduce water pollution is to follow the "Three Rs" approach: Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle. This means using 
            less water and resources, reusing water for different purposes, and recycling water through treatment processes. Here are some 
            examples of how the Three Rs can help us save water and reduce water pollution:
            <br>
            <b>a) Reduce:</b> We can reduce our water consumption by taking shorter showers, turning off the faucet when not in use, fixing leaks, 
            installing low-flow devices, and choosing water-efficient appliances. We can also reduce the amount of pollutants we generate by 
            disposing of chemicals and fuel properly, avoiding the use of pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers, and minimizing our use of 
            plastic products<br>
            <b>b) Reuse:</b> We can reuse water for different purposes, such as watering plants, flushing toilets, washing cars, or cleaning floors. 
            We can also reuse rainwater by collecting it in barrels or tanks and using it for irrigation or other non-potable uses. We can 
            also reuse plastic bottles, bags, or containers instead of throwing them away or buying new ones<br>
            <b>c) Recycle:</b> We can recycle water by treating it through various processes, such as filtration, disinfection, reverse osmosis, or 
            advanced oxidation. These processes can remove pollutants and make water safe for drinking or other uses. We can also recycle 
            plastic by sorting it and sending it to recycling facilities, where it can be melted and turned into new products<br>
        </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <b>3. Stormwater Management</b>
    Implementing effective stormwater management practices is crucial. This includes using permeable surfaces, vegetated buffers, and 
    retention basins to prevent runoff from carrying pollutants into rivers and streams.
    <br><div class="strmwater">
        <div id="strmwater_b"><b>Steps to Prevent Storm Water Pollution</b></div>
        <p>A homeowner could install a rain barrel on their roof to collect rainwater for watering their lawn or garden.
            This would reduce the amount of stormwater runoff that enters storm drains.
           A developer could build a green roof on a new office building. This would help to reduce stormwater runoff and pollutants from
            entering the storm drain system.
           A city could install bioswales along a busy road to filter stormwater runoff before it enters a nearby river. This would help 
           to improve the water quality of the river</p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <b>4. Wastewater Treatment</b>
    Municipalities and industries must ensure proper treatment of sewage and industrial wastewater. Treatment plants should effectively remove
     contaminants before discharge into water bodies.
     <br>
     <div class="wstewater">
        <div id="wstewater_p"><b>Steps to Prevent Water Pollution</b></div>
        <p><b>Collection:</b> Wastewater is collected through a network of pipes and pumping stations, forming a sewer system. This system 
            transports wastewater from homes, businesses, and industries to a central treatment facility. Properly designed and maintained
             sewer systems prevent leakages and overflows that could lead to direct contamination of water sources.
            <br>
            <b>Treatment:</b> Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) play a critical role in removing pollutants from wastewater before it is 
            discharged into the environment. The treatment process typically involves multiple stages, including:
            <br>
            &emsp;<b>a. Primary Treatment:</b> This stage removes large solids and debris through settling and filtration processes.
            <br>
            &emsp;<b>b. Secondary Treatment:</b> This stage utilizes biological processes to break down organic matter and reduce nutrient levels.
            <br>
            &emsp;<b>c. Tertiary Treatment:</b> This stage employs advanced techniques to remove specific pollutants, such as phosphorus, nitrogen, and heavy metals.
            <br>
            The level of treatment required depends on the characteristics of the wastewater and the receiving water body.
            <br>
            <b>Disposal or Reuse:</b> Treated wastewater can either be discharged into a water body or reused for various purposes. Discharged wastewater should meet stringent water quality standards to ensure minimal impact on the receiving water body. Reuse options include irrigation, industrial processes, and even potable water supply after advanced treatment.</p>
     </div>
     <br>
    <b>5. Sustainable Agriculture</b>
    Encouraging farmers to adopt sustainable agricultural practices can help reduce the use of fertilizers and pesticides, control soil 
    erosion, and protect water quality.
    <br>
    <div class="susagri">
        <div id="susagri_b"><b>Prevention from Sustainable Agriculture</b></div>
        <p>
            a) Reducing the use of pesticides and fertilizers. Pesticides and fertilizers can run off into waterways and pollute them.<br> 
            b) Sustainable agriculture practices focus on using natural methods to control pests and improve soil health, which can reduce 
            the need for synthetic pesticides and fertilizers.<br>
            c) Implementing conservation practices. Conservation practices, such as cover cropping, crop rotation, and contour farming, can help to 
            reduce soil erosion and runoff. This can help to prevent pollutants from entering waterways.<br>
            d) Managing livestock waste properly. Livestock waste can contain a variety of pollutants, including bacteria, nutrients, and heavy metals. <br>
            e) Sustainable agriculture practices focus on managing livestock waste in a way that minimizes its impact on water quality.<br>
        </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <b>6. Riparian Buffer Zones</b>
    Preserving natural buffer zones along water bodies with native vegetation acts as a natural filter, preventing pollutants from entering 
    the water and reducing soil erosion.
    <br>
    <div class="ripzone">
        <div id="ripzone_b"><b>Methods for Riparian Buffer Zone</b></div>
        <p><b>Filter runoff:</b> RBZs can filter runoff from agricultural and urban areas, removing pollutants such as sediment, nutrients, and 
            pesticides from the water before it enters a waterway.<br>
            <b>Stabilize stream banks:</b> RBZs help to stabilize stream banks by reducing erosion. This helps to prevent sediment from entering
             waterways and can also help to improve water clarity.<br>
            <b>Provide habitat for aquatic life:</b> RBZs provide habitat for a variety of aquatic life, including fish, birds, and insects. 
            This helps to support a healthy ecosystem and can also help to improve water quality.
        </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <b>7. Education and Awareness</b>
    Raising awareness about the importance of water conservation and pollution prevention is critical. Educational campaigns can inform 
    communities, businesses, and individuals about their roles in preserving water quality.
    <br>
    <div class="eduaawar">
        <div id="eduaawar_b"><b>Ways to Educate and Raise Awareness</b></div>
        <p>
            <b>School programs:</b> Schools can teach students about water pollution and the importance of protecting water resources. This 
            can be done through science classes, environmental education programs, and extracurricular activities.<br>
            <b>Public awareness campaigns:</b> Public awareness campaigns can be used to educate the general public about water pollution and 
            how to prevent it. These campaigns can be conducted through television, radio, print, and social media.<br>
            </b>Community outreach programs:</b> Community outreach programs can be used to educate specific groups of people about water 
            pollution, such as farmers, businesses, and homeowners. These programs can be conducted through workshops, seminars, and one-on-
            one outreach.<br>
        </p>
    </div>
    <br>

    <b>8. Regulation and Enforcement</b>
    Stringent environmental regulations must be implemented and enforced to hold industries and individuals accountable for their actions 
    related to water pollution.
    <br>
    <div class="reguaenfo">
        <div id="reguaenfo_b"><b>Regular Monitoring And Enforcement Water Pollution</b></div>
        <p>
            The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) conducts regular monitoring of water quality in rivers, lakes, and other water 
            bodies across the United States. The EPA uses this data to assess the quality of the nation's waters and to identify areas 
            where water pollution is a problem.<br>
            State environmental agencies also conduct regular monitoring of water quality. In addition, many states have programs that 
            allow private businesses to monitor water quality under the supervision of the state agency.<br>
            The EPA and state environmental agencies also enforce water pollution regulations. They do this by inspecting facilities for 
            compliance with regulations, issuing warning letters and fines, and taking legal action against violators.<br>
        </p>
    </div>
    <br>

    <b>9. Monitoring and Reporting</b>
    Regular monitoring of water quality is essential. Swift reporting of pollution incidents to relevant authorities is crucial to initiate 
    prompt corrective action.
    <br>
    <div class="moniarep">
        <div id="moniarep_b"><b>Monitoring And Reporting Methods</b></div>
        <p>
            The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) conducts nationwide water quality monitoring and reporting through its National 
            Water Quality Inventory (305(b) Report) and its National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit Program.<br>
            Many state environmental agencies also conduct water quality monitoring and reporting.<br>
            Environmental organizations, such as the Sierra Club and the Natural Resources Defense Council, also conduct water quality 
            monitoring and reporting.<br>
            Some private businesses, such as utilities and manufacturing companies, also conduct water quality monitoring and reporting.
        </p>
    </div>
    <br>

    <b>10. Sustainable Development</b>
    Urban planning and development should prioritize sustainability. Reducing impervious surfaces, implementing green infrastructure, and 
    protecting natural water bodies in city planning can prevent pollution.
    <br>
    <div class="susdevo">
        <div id="susdevo_b"><b>Steps for Sustainable Development</b></div>
        <p>
            <b>Investing in water and sanitation infrastructure.</b> This includes building and maintaining wastewater treatment plants, 
            sewer systems, and stormwater management systems.<br>
            <b>Promoting sustainable agricultural practices.</b> This includes reducing the use of pesticides and fertilizers, and 
            implementing conservation practices such as cover cropping and contour farming.<br>
            <b>Protecting and restoring ecosystems.</b> Ecosystems play an important role in filtering pollutants and improving water quality.<br>
            <b>Educating and raising awareness.</b> It is important for people to understand the causes and consequences of water 
            pollution, and how to prevent it.<br><br>

            A city could build a new wastewater treatment plant that uses renewable energy and produces high-quality effluent that can be 
            reused for irrigation or other purposes. This would help to reduce water pollution and conserve water resources.<br>
            A farmer could plant a buffer zone of native plants along a stream that runs through their property. This would help to filter
             runoff from their fields and prevent pollutants from entering the stream.<br>
            A homeowner could install a rainwater collection system to collect rainwater from their roof and use it to water their lawn 
            or garden. This would help to reduce their reliance on municipal water supplies and reduce stormwater runoff.<br>
            A school could teach students about the causes and consequences of water pollution, and how to prevent it. This could be 
            done through science classes, environmental education programs, and extracurricular activities.<br>
