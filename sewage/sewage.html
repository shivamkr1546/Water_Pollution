            <p>
                Untreated sewage contains a variety of disease-causing microorganisms, such as bacteria, viruses, and
                parasites. These microorganisms can cause a variety of illnesses, including diarrhea, vomiting,

            <h3>Depletion of dissolved oxygen</h3>
            <p>
                Sewage contains organic matter, which is decomposed by bacteria. This process consumes oxygen, which can
                deplete the dissolved oxygen levels in water. Low dissolved oxygen levels can suffocate aquatic life and
                create "dead zones" where no life can survive.

            <h3>Introduction of nutrients:</h3>
            <p>
                Sewage contains nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus. These nutrients can stimulate the growth of
                algae, which can lead to algal blooms. Algal blooms can block out sunlight and consume oxygen, which can
                harm aquatic life and create dead zones.

                Sewage can contain a variety of toxic chemicals, such as heavy metals, pesticides, and herbicides. These
                chemicals can harm aquatic life and make water unsafe for human consumption.

            <h3>Sewage overflows:</h3>
            <p>
                Sewage overflows occur when sewage treatment plants are overloaded or when there is a break in a sewer
                line. Sewage overflows can discharge large amounts of untreated sewage into waterways.

        <div class="Combined_sewer_overflows">
            <h3>Combined sewer overflows (CSOs):</h3>
            <p>
                Many older sewer systems combine stormwater runoff and sewage. During heavy rains, these systems can
                overflow and discharge untreated sewage into waterways.

        <div class="Septic_tank_failures">
            <h3>Septic tank failures: </h3>
            <p>
                Septic tanks are used to treat sewage in homes and businesses that are not connected to a municipal
                sewer system. If a septic tank fails, it can discharge untreated sewage into the ground or into nearby
                waterways.

            <p>
                Some people illegally dump sewage or other hazardous waste into waterways. This can cause serious water
                pollution.

            Controlling pollution in water is essential for preserving natural resources, protecting ecosystems, and
            ensuring the long-term sustainability of food production. It often requires a combination of regulatory
            measures, education, and the adoption of best practices by people.
            It's important to note that the specific strategies to reduce pollution in water can vary by region and type
            of water. Sustainable and environmentally friendly farming practices should be tailored to local conditions
            and regulations. Collaboration between farmers, government agencies, and environmental organizations is
            often necessary to implement effective pollution-reduction measures in water.
